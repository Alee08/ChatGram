# Builds and runs on GNU/Linux:
```
make && make test
```
Binary generated: ```./build/wmbusmeters```

```
make DEBUG=true
```

Binary generated: ```./build_debug/wmbusmeters```

# Run Chat
1. Launch ChatGram on the two PCs equipped with the iM871A-USB with the command: 

```
./build_debug/wmbusmeters --debug/dev/im871a.
```


In this way we are sniffing all the telegrams sent in the vicinity.

2. Send telegrams until we find the address of the two devices.

3. Then restart the receive program like this:
```
./build_debug/wmbusmeters /dev/im871a MyMeter generico 00101249 ""
```
(where you replace 00101249 with the message address you received.)

4. Now the two devices are ready to chat with each other!

# IM871A-USB detection
* It is possible to add a rule to let you easily identify your iM871a:

Create the file: ```/etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules``` with the content:
```
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea60", SYMLINK+="im871a",MODE="0660", GROUP="yourowngroup"
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", SYMLINK+="amb8465",MODE="0660", GROUP="yourowngroup"
```
* Or whenever the device is not found, run this command from the terminal:

```
chown user:user /dev/ttyUSB0
```

Replace "user" with your username

The ChatGram project is based on the Fredrik Öhrström wmbusmeters project which I thank very much for the help.
